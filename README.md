# DrakesQuestBSystem

# Update: This repository has served the purpose and has begun being implemented in the DrakesQuestV1.0 repository. 

This repository is for development, testing, and desiging of the battle system mechanics for Drakes Quest.
Once this system is flushed out, it will be used in conjuction with my JavaFX application DrakesQuest.

## This project contains:
* Battle logic ideas for the turn based system
* Classes that handle Enemies and Heroes of the game
* Scrapped for now: Weapons, Armor, Magic, and other needed Classes.
